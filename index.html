                    <p class="information">&ensp;&ensp;I began to learn programming independently on my own initiative. I never thought about any activity in this area. I was offered to study because it is a demanded and highly paid job and I decided to give it a try. It turned out that programming is a very interesting activity, which "dragged me", so I decided to go further. Therefore, I am here.<br>
                        &ensp;&ensp; In fact, I am just starting my way and, in fact, can not do anything. I learned HTML and CSS, but haven’t yet practiced in a normal way, and I speak English very poorly. I only have the desire, time and people who can help me learn, so I can learn quickly enough. Sometimes it happens that the training is difficult or easy. For me, everything that I already learned was given quite easily. Although I haven’t learned much, how easily and quickly I did it pleases me.<br>
                        &ensp;&ensp;My <strong>goal</strong> is to learn everything that is necessary in order to be a good programmer, because I need a job that I love and that brings good money.</p>
